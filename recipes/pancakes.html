    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>

        <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>6 tablespoons milk</li>

        <li>4 teaspoons white sugar, divided</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>


        <li>1/4 teaspoon lemon juice</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon powdered sugar for dusting (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine egg yolks, flour, milk, 2 teaspoons white sugar, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl; whisk until batter is smooth.</li>

        <li>Combine egg whites and lemon juice in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl and beat until soft peaks form. Add egg whites to yolk mixture and carefully fold in using a spatula until just combined, using as light a touch as possible.</li>

        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Transfer batter into the hot pan, cover, and cook until the bottom is golden brown and bubbles appear on the surface, about 4 minutes.</li>

        <li>Use a spatula to cut the pancake into 4 sections and flip over. Cover and cook for another minute. Use 2 spatulas to tear or cut the pancake into 1 to 2 inch pieces.</li>

        <li>Add remaining butter in little pieces to the pan and sprinkle with remaining 2 teaspoons white sugar. Cook tossing and stirring for a few minutes until pancake pieces are lightly caramelized at the edges.</li>

        <li>Serve immediately, dusted with powdered sugar.</li>
